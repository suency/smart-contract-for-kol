# Smart Contract for KOL

It helps business sectors to make transparent transactions with customers and KOL can get benefits from smart contract. Everyone can monitor the smart contract and what percentage of benefits KOL get. Once the smart contract is depolyed, no one can change it.

### Features

1. The project leverages Solidity to decentralize transaction processes between sellers, buyers, and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), enabling transparent monitoring of transactions by all parties involved.
2. All transaction data is stored on the blockchain, ensuring data accuracy and preventing the inclusion of fraudulent information.
3. The platform provides role-based access control, allowing each user to access specific features within our Content Management System (CMS). Sellers can log in to the platform and deploy their own smart contracts, while KOLs can only view transaction data without the ability to deploy contracts.
4. Our project consists of four components: the App's frontend, the App's backend, the CMS's frontend, and the CMS's backend. The separation of frontend and backend components allows for future scalability. For instance, as user numbers grow, we can incorporate additional robust backend frameworks like Go or Java. Currently, we utilize a simple and efficient PHP framework for testing the feasibility of our product.
5. Users have the flexibility to deploy our custom-designed smart contracts on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains, including Polygon and Polygon ZKEVM.
6. Traditionally, once a contract is deployed, it cannot be modified. However, our platform supports a form of "modification." Sellers can edit contract information, such as commission percentages, by deploying a new contract. This process allows sellers to perceive it as a modification while adhering to the immutability principle of smart contracts.

## Getting Started

You can just run the MVP which is a simple react Application and it can interact with EVM compatible chains. Currently, it is still under development and functions is limited.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- Node 16++
- Express for backend services

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Say what the step will be

```bash
cd mvp
npm install
```

And same for server side

## Deployment

You can use react application to deploy the smart contract
